# musicOH
MusicOH is an alternative to the popular music/film chart generator called "Topsters". Although Topsters has been pretty reliable in use, I wanted to implement a lot of the dream features I had into a new client that focused on music features and integrations; considering how users like me share and consume  our music.

Trying to make a good chart rendered for personal use :)
Title inspired by Xiu Xiu
